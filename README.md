the tech stack used here is:

the python programming language
pandas to create dataframes to better visualize the results
sqlalchemy to connect to the database
psycopg2 to connect to database
jupyter notebooks to better visualize the tables being queried
a python virtual environment
git to send the code to github
postgresql is the database used 

some of the code is written in jupyter notebooks and some other code is written 
in plain python files and organized in classes and methods.
